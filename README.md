A simple web application for managing user data. This app allows the following operations:
Add User: Add a new user to the system with basic details such as name, email, and role.
Delete User: Remove an existing user from the system.
Update User: Modify an existing user's information, including name, email, and role.
Insert User: Similar to Add User, but specifically handles batch insertion or entry of multiple users at once.
The application is built using a combination of front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end (Node.js, Express)
technologies. The back-end API handles the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user data.
Features:

User authentication and authorization (optional).
Simple and intuitive UI for managing users.
Uses local storage or a database for persistent data (e.g., MongoDB).
CRUD operations exposed via RESTful API.
Technologies:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a frontend framework like React or Vue if applicable).
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB, MySQL, or in-memory data store (based on implementation).
